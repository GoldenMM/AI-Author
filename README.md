# AI Book Author
The goal of this project is to have an app which can take in a prompt for a book idea. And work with the user
to flesh out the book to completion.

## Features
- Front end chat for usability
- Have a 'TODO' list of items required eg (chapter 1.1, 1.2) and have the code be able to piece it all together
- Be intelligent enough to ask for clarification from the user
- Format the book with headers and the like. (maybe image gen later)
- a download feature
- Have it be able to change tone and writing style so it doesn't seem lifeless


Make sure to use json.dumps to parse dict to json in responses
